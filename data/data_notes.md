### Data Folder
The data folder in the Question Answering System Repo serves as a repository for a diverse collection of document types that are used by the system. 
It contains various files or directories representing different types of documents, such as PDFs, text files, or web pages. 
These documents serve as the knowledge base for the question answering system, 
enabling it to retrieve relevant information and provide accurate answers to user queries.
